# countdown-timer
Small app that uses raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an event countdown. 

## Requirements
User should be able to enter multiple events and see them all counting down simultaneously after entering a name, date and optional starting time. No external packages or frameworks allowed.

To run the application, clone the repository, then open the index.html file in a browser :D Better build instructions coming in the future, but for now I've been using the Live Server extension in VSCode.
